## Sports Team Data Processor

This project was part of an undergraduate assignment focused on **file processing, exception handling, and data serialization in Java**. The goal was to read and organize sports team records from multiple CSV files, validate them for errors, and store valid records efficiently.

The program **detects syntax and semantic errors** using **custom exception handling**, logs issues in dedicated error files, and organizes data into separate files based on the sport type. It then **serializes the valid records into binary files** to ensure efficient storage and retrieval.

An **interactive command-line interface** allows users to navigate through deserialized records, query team statistics, and analyze performance trends. This assignment reinforced key **object-oriented programming (OOP) principles**, including **encapsulation, file I/O, error handling, and object serialization**.
